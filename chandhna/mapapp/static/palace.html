                Bengaluru Palace, built in 1878, is inspired by Englandâ€™s Windsor Castle with its stunning Tudor-style architecture and fortified towers.
It was once the royal residence of the Wodeyar dynasty of Mysore.
Today, it serves as a popular tourist attraction and venue for cultural events and concerts.
